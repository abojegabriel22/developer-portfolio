                I can even teach my sister how to build a simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites
                and learn advanced topics.

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer.
                 I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it.
                 And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
